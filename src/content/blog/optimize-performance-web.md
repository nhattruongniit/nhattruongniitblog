#### What is Web Performance Optimization?
Web performance optimization is the process of improving the speed and performance of your website. It involves optimizing various aspects of your site, such as page load times, image sizes, and code efficiency, to ensure that your site loads quickly and runs smoothly.

#### Why is Web Performance Optimization Important?
Web performance optimization is important for a number of reasons. First and foremost, a fast-loading website provides a better user experience, which can lead to increased engagement and conversions. Additionally, search engines like Google consider page speed when ranking websites, so a faster site can help improve your search engine rankings.

#### Tips for Optimizing Web Performance
Here are some tips for optimizing the performance of your website:
<br /><br />
